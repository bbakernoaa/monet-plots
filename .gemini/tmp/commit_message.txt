feat: Implement context-based style switching and update docs

This commit introduces a new `set_style` function in `monet_plots/style.py`
that allows users to easily switch between predefined plotting styles
(e.g., "wiley", "presentation", "paper", "web") based on a context string.

The `docs/configuration/basic-styling.md` file has been updated to:
- Reflect the use of the new `set_style` function.
- Remove redundant style definitions that are now managed centrally.
- Provide clear examples of how to use `set_style` for different contexts.
- Update the "Quick Reference" table to include the `set_style` function.
